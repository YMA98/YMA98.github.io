    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Crime is a significant issue that affects communities worldwide, and the city of Los Angeles is no exception. According to the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD), there were over 210,000 reported crimes in the city in 2020 alone, ranging from theft and robbery to assault and homicide. The impact of crime on communities is far-reaching, from personal trauma to economic costs, and it is crucial to understand its distribution and trends to address it effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, our team has undertaken a data visualization project on crime in Los Angeles City, utilizing a dataset representing the incidents of crime in the city dating back to 2020. To make the data more manageable, we narrowed our focus to the years 2023 and beyond, reducing the number of rows from 700,000 to 60,000. Through our project, we aim to provide insights into the distribution and patterns of crime in LA City, allowing for better decision-making and policy implementation."

    "## Dashboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Our dashboard comprises two main components: the left section showcases a plot that displays the age, descent, and sex of victims population, while the right section presents the count of criminal records grouped by area names of the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "The left section of the dashboard focuses on the demographics of crime victims, providing an insight into who is most vulnerable to crime with different colors representing different demographic groups. By selecting a particular area, users can view the specific number of criminal records connected to the selected victim group, and distributions in different areas. This interactivity makes it easier to compare the demographics of victims in different ages, descent, gender between different regions of the city."

So, we found out a way to evaluate whether a city is dangerous or not through crime data. We chose LA city data as an example to make an interactive visualization plot showing the crime situation of the city. The result showed many useful information and let us learn the importance of data visualization in real world."
